		The iodeg program

Usage and input files are as will other programs in the distrat/askmap
package.  So run it with the -h option of a list of command line
options, etc.  If you don't know how these work, read the
documentation for distrat which contains general information
about commands and file forms.

% iodeg -h
CM IOdeg. Copyright 1994 by Jeff Goldberg
Usage: C:\BIN\IODEG.EXE [options] file
   or  C:\BIN\IODEG.EXE [options] -f listfile
	files contains a map
	listfile contains a list of files
	Options:
		-h	display this message
		-v	set verbose flag [off]
		-d num	set debug flag to num [0]
		-n num	set max. distinct nodes [300]
		-m num	set max. maps in list [200]
		-t num	set type of map file [1]
		-A num	set alpha to num [1]

Generally, the output of iodeg looks like:

In-degrees for map TUN-0792-01:
		    2:     7  (+17.000)
		    6:     9  (+23.000)
		   13:     6  (+15.000)
		   27:     5  (+13.000)
		   36:     9  (+22.000)
		   37:     9  (+26.000)
		   41:     8  (+18.000)
		   43:     3  (+6.000)
		   47:     7  (+16.000)
		   49:     3  (+7.000)
Out-degrees for map TUN-0792-01
		    2:     6  (+12.000)
		    6:     8  (+23.000)
		   13:     7  (+17.000)
		   27:     6  (+13.000)
		   36:     6  (+15.000)
		   37:     6  (+16.000)
		   41:     7  (+19.000)
		   43:     6  (+16.000)
		   47:     7  (+17.000)
		   49:     7  (+15.000)

The first column is the node number, the second is the in-degree
or out-degree of the node (number of arcs leading to it, number
of arcs leading from it).  The third number is the sum of the
absolute values of the weights of the arcs leading in (or out).

If you want this same information, but sorted or arranged differently
it is time to learn at least some awk, and maybe some sed.  Or
edit the output by hand.
