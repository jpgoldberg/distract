		The cmtran program

The cmtran program is not usable as is.  It is intended to act as
a skelaton for programs to write programs which translate maps
of one form into maps of another.  If you are a programmer, then
please read the comments and code in cmtran.c, readmap.c, and
writemap.c.

BUGS, LIMITS

Currently there are no hooks to other information which may be
desired in a map.  I plan to fix this ``any day now.''
