		The density program

The density of a map is the ratio of arcs to places where there could
be arcs.  For example, in a 5 node map in which we do not consider
reflexive arcs (arcs from a node to the same node) there are 10
places were there could be arcs.  If there are ten arcs within such a
map, then the map has a density of 1.0, if there are none, then the
density is 0.0.  If the map has, say, six arcs then the density is
6/10, or 0.6.

Usage and input files are as will other programs in the
distrat/askmap package.  So run it with the -h option of a list of
command line options, etc.  If you don't know how these work, read
the documentation for distrat which contains general information
about commands and file forms.

% density -h
CM Density. Copyright 1993, 1994 by Jeff Goldberg
Usage: C:\BIN\DENSITY.EXE [options] file
   or  C:\BIN\DENSITY.EXE [options] -f listfile
	files contains a map
	listfile contains a list of files
	Options:
		-h	display this message
		-v	set verbose flag [off]
		-d num	set debug flag to num [0]
		-n num	set max. distinct nodes [300]
		-m num	set max. maps in list [200]
		-t num	set type of map file [1]
		-A num	set alpha to num [1]

Output is fairly straight forward:
% density tun01
CM Density. Copyright 1993, 1994 by Jeff Goldberg
Density(TUN-0792-01) = 0.7333
