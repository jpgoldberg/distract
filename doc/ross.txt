The ross program simply displays the Ross ordering of on N elements.
The ordering was developed by Ross (1938).

The program, as an independent program, is not needed directly for
causal map analysis or elicitation.  The basic calculation is needed
for the askmap program, and once that was written, it took no more
that a few minutes to write a stand alone program.

It's usage is simple:

% ross 7
1: 1 2
2: 7 3
3: 6 4
4: 5 1
5: 3 2
6: 4 7
7: 5 6
8: 1 3
9: 2 4
10: 7 5
11: 6 1
12: 4 3
13: 5 2
14: 6 7
15: 1 4
16: 3 5
17: 2 6
18: 7 1
19: 4 5
20: 3 6
21: 2 7


LIMITATIONS:

% ross 200
rossify(): must be no more than 181 elements
Error getting ross array

The 181 is not an arbitrary number (It is the greatest
integer N such that (N^2-N)/2 <= 65536/4.
On some computers the largest single array you can request
is 65536 bytes without writing machine and compiler specific code,
and 4 is the maximum size of the element of such an array on
such a machine.)

Unless you have found a use of Ross ordering that is new to me, then
it is unlikely that you will need it for more than 30 elements.  For
the purposes of Ross ordering, if you really want more that 181
elements, you could safely give up on the Ross ordering, and just
order your pairs randomly.
